- a CLI to record students, courses, students' 
enrollment in courses and grades

- persistence to be implemented in MySQL, with 
validation mostly on the databse side

- some courses will have other courses as 
prerequisites, e.g. Course requires CourseA to 
have been taken with a minimum grade of 70

- the program should record integer grades for 
each course, but also have the ability to transalte 
to letter grades, e.g. 92-> A, 81 -> B

- should generate transcripts and enrollment 
reports for a student, as well show top students 
(by gpa) and top courses (by enrollment)
